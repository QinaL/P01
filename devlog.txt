thomasY -- 2021-12-09 20:37
- Updated design doc
- Fixed tables to deal avoid lists in a db entry/row
  - Insead opting for a table per user (table name = username)
- Added to API section
  - Explained more clearly what each trivia API provides and what we want to use them for

qinaL -- 2021-12-09 21:28
- added some small specifications/illustration to database
- added optional risky questions for if we have additional time to implement to increase fun factor

yayingLL -- 2021-12-10 09:20
- added project description

qinaL -- 2021-12-11 22:58
- added requirements.txt

qinaL -- 2021-12-12 16:03
- added Flask to __init__.py, now can run __init__.py to get functional localhost website
- created templates and home.html with link to css and bootstrap
- created static and css folder and style.css
- now have home landing page that displays summary pitch of site

joshuaK -- 2021-12-12 18:05
- added login, register, and table structure

qinaL -- 2021-12-13 20:11
- added css links to login and regiser html
- made it so can see home page and use trivia w/o loggging in
- register and login buttons are on separate pages so traversing login --> register --> login is more intuitive now
- still need to do
    - when users fails to register and logi (bad username/password, login w/o register)
    - need home page to change when logged in (no login button b/c user is logged in
- issue
    - if user does not land on "/" page first, then table won't be created

yayingLL -- 2021-12-14 16:29
- added error handling for register page (no username, no password, password don't match, username taken)

qinaL -- 2021-12-14 19:23
- changed href="home" in navbar to href="/" because the former threw an error
- /auth get method redirects to /login and not / anymore
- added login error handling for when username is empty, username is not found in database, or the password is wrong

thomasY -- 2021-12-14 21:01
- Update from class period: Got a working navbar
- Added Jinja2 if statement to login and signup
  - Will only show up if the user is not logged in
  - Added logout to show up when the user is logged in

qinaL -- 2021-12-15
- login works now (i think?, i hope), wont throw wrong password error when right password
    - c.fetchone()[0] because c.fetchone is ('e',)

yayingLL -- 2021-12-15 23:27
- fixed bindings error in register page (added , to signify values were tuples)
- fixed wrong password error in login page (qina's observations were a big yes! convert tuple into string, then compare passwords)
- added gathering of trivia questions from api
- displayed question, answer, and incorrect answers into trivia.html page

thoamsY -- 2021-12-16 09:13
- Created profile.html
- Added if statements and for loops to create the different sections of the page

yayingLL -- 2021-12-16 22:43
- added axolotl, dog, and cat api collection of data to Flask
- created collectibles.html for displaying animal and description

joshuaK -- 2021-12-15
- started asking trivia question and recieving answer

joshuaK -- 2021-12-16
- fully functional trivia question multiple choice

qinaL -- 2021-12-19 16:14
- swapped out session['username'] for session.get('username'); idk why or how but the former throws an error in trivia
- changed animal-specific fucntions to return a tuple of (pic, desc) rather than rendering template
    - render_template of collectibles.html is in trivia
    - inserting collectible data into table is also in trivia
    - trivia for when answer is correct now works w/p (hopefully) any errors
- added to collectibles.html so when getting a collectible and not logged in, a message of "To keep this collectible, please log in!" in red is given
- created base.html as the parent template for jinja inheritance (only burn.html extends off it, other templates not converted for jinja inheritance yet)
- created burn.html for when user gets question wrong and the collectible is burned; only displays collectible and a message saying it's burned, but the style/css leaves much to be desired and the burning effect of image still needs work
    - when answer is wrong, this template is rendered instead of redirecting to home page

qinaL -- 2021-12-19 20:19
- moved creation of users database from "/" to "/login"
- added CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS to "/register" for users.db in case users goes directly to "/register" and skipped table creation in "/login"
- added some <br> to collectibles.html and burn.html so formatting of page looks nicer
- tested to see if code for adding collectible when logged in works, fixed some errors I found, (hopefully) works now but there should probably be more testing
- added "/logout" so users can now logout
- got rid of login button on the home page (it looked bad), log in + log out will be allocated only to navbar
- added an catch for when logged in users try to login; loggedlock.html (uses jinja inheritance) is rendered instead
- found error: if user does trivia, navbar will show logout even if not logged in because session has correct_answer and navbar checks for if session is empty to determine if it's logged in or not
    - fixed error by changing {% if session %} to {% if session['username'] %}
    - fixed only in trivia.html and base.html; too tired to copy paste it into the other templates

yayingLL -- 2021-12-19 21:00
- moved inserting collectible to the person's database ONLY if they got the correct answer
- deleted previous db file because it didn't include Number column
  - all users registered from now on have a Number column
- randomized presentation of answers in trivia questions
  - previously, correct answer would always be the last choice

yayingLL -- 2021-12-20 9:23
- incorporated jinja inheritance with base.html for most pages

qinaL -- 2021-12-20 20:06
- added try except blocks in the code that gets api info; if api fails, animal-specific functions returns "Error," which trivia catches for and renders error.html to tell user that the site is currently down
    - THOU SHALT NOT FAIL
    - error.html was created

yayingLL -- 2021-12-20 23:39
- started on hints -- relationships are so complex

thomasY -- 2021-12-21 09:07
- Updated collectibles and burn so the image has a max height
- Images now resize alongside the browser window

joshuaK -- 2021-12-21 9:15
- made it so if logged out and than log in the collectible is saved

qinaL -- 2021-12-21 18:18
- there was an issue with the implementation of logged out but logging in the save collectible, throws an error when you go back to home w/o saving collectibe; fixed error
- changed style of site a bit

joshuaK -- 2021-12-22 9:15
- made it so imgur are cleansed cause security issue does not allow us to display them very sad

qinaL -- 2021-12-22 9:24
- added a fire image to burn; it's a bit clunky, will fix soon

thomasY -- 2021-12-22 23:32
- Created route /profile
- Implemented a basic profile page that displays the users collectibles when logged in

qinaL -- 2021-12-23 13:57
- trivia api 1 (opentdb) kept throwing an error; the info given from api was processed wrong (the dict given was confusing); I fixed it so it works now

qinaL -- 2021-12-23 14:14
- added some more comments to /trivia so code is easier to read; cleaned up some extraneous code; fixed other errors found
    - hopefully code looks nicer now
    - api 0 and 1 should work fine now
    - api 2 has an issue where you must inputted exactly as correct answer so if correct answer was "<i>Lonesome Dove</i>" Lonesome Dove was wrong

qinaL -- 2021-12-23 22:24
- overlayed collectible over fire image using bootstrap's card feature (different method was used last time but it didn't make fire image responsive so i changed it)
    - collectible is in center of fire
    - collectible is also slightly transparent so it looks like its being burned (and so if user wants to see clear image, they'll need to actually collect the image)
- maded a slightly rounded border to the collectible images b/c i think it makes it look nicer
- also for jinja inherited templates, {# ... #} is how you make comments

qinaL -- 2021-12-29 22:26
- added try except blocks to all 3 trivia apis in case they fail
- made error image fluid and fit page
- transported trivia api 0 and 1 into separate individual functions so their structure matches that of collectibles with calling apis and rendering in /trivia
    - this makes /trivia shorter and avoids repeating code of rendering 'trivia.html'
    - trivia api 2 wasn't given separate function because it uses a different template b/c it's short answer
- add some more comments to make code hopefully easier to understand

qinaL -- 2021-12-31 23:29
- added hint counter display and hint button on /trivia
    - only shows if logged in
- created functions getNumOfHints() and hint(), and new route of /hint for when hint button is pressed
    - users can now log in, see how many hints they have, and press hint button, which reloads same question and answer choices with one wrong answer choice eliminated
- only for /trivia, so only works for mc questions; sa will be implemented soon

qinaL -- 2021-01-01 0:33
- made hint button disappear if user has 0 hints
- forgot to decrease # of hints users has in database last time; implemented this time
- implemented catch so that if only 1 answer choice remains, user can't see/use hints
- SA hints
    - hint button appears for triviasa.html
    - if pressed, a page with same qu loads
    - actual hint function to be implemented

qinaL -- 2021-01-01 23:46
- SA correct answer filter implemented
    - makes case irrelevant
    - makes quotes for ans with albums/books/etc not required
    - api answers with <i> can be correct
        - ex: if ans by api is <i>House</i>, a user inputting house is correct
    - function filterSA() was created for this; it is called in /trivia POST

qinaL -- 2021-01-02 0:47
- made it so <i> part of SA answer is gone in session['correct_answer'] so when user gets qu wrong and correct answer is displayed, the <> isn't shown
    - put prev code that did this that was in filterSA() into new function cleanSA()
- changed format of profile
    - now displays number of how many collectibles a user has
        - getNumOfCollection() was created to do so
    - to see collection, a link is given to send user to /collection
- /collection and collection.html made to display all the collectibles user has gotten

qinaL -- 2021-01-02 13:14
- implemented Short Answer hints
    - user can press hint button on SA qu to get first 2 letters (or if ans is 2 letters or less, only the first letter)
    - hintUsed() function created so both hint() and hintsa() can call it to decrease num of hint in db w/o repeating code
- profile now displays num of hints user has

joshuaK -- 2021-01-02-16:51
- made questions saved for user so no repeats

thomasY -- 2021-01-02 18:55
- Added a check to make sure the username is alphanumeric when registering
- Added a htmlDecode function that deals with default encoding for questions generated from OpenTrivia
  - Only deals with "", '', &

thomasY -- 2021-01-02 20:21
- Removed htmlDecode and just made the variables safe in the templates
  - Passes through the string without doing anything to it
- Made all the buttons the same type
- Added Bootstrap to login and register forms

qinaL -- 2021-01-02 21:49
- num of achivements is now shown on profile
    - getAchievements() and getNumOfAchievements() created to do this
- button to send user to their achievements page is implemented on profile
    - achievements.html and /achievements created to do this
- there are 3 achievements users can get dependent on how many collectibles they have
    - achievements page shows status of each achievements (and color of each achievement will reflect status)
    - rewards for each achievement not implemented yet

qinaL -- 2021-01-02 21:56
- added db to repo b/c it has an admin account w/ 98 collectibles (will be used to showcase in demo)
    - username: admin; password: 1

qinaL -- 2021-01-02 23:08
- num of Special Collectibles is shown on profile and button now send to their specials page
- specials page implemented
    - /specials and specials.html created to do so
    - there is an images folder in the static folder that holds the 3 images for the special collectibles
    - uses bootstrap cards (i think it looks pretty neat! :D)
    - there are 3 special collectibles, each as a reward for the 3 achievements
- admin account doesn't work b/c database has changed; will need new plan for this

qinaL -- 2021-01-03 00:03
- there was an error with registering cuz of a missing ); fixed it
- in trivia.html, got rid of <br> and instead gave buttons a margin of 3px b/c it makes the spacing better

yayingLL -- 2022-01-03 00:58:08
- HAPPY NEW YEAR!! don't forget it's 2022 now LOL ygs cute
- fixed KeyError: 'Username'; was occurring because user attempts trivia without logging in (even tho our design said it should be possible)
  - no worries, try/catched the error; if error occurs, redirect to /login

yayingLL -- 2022-01-03 01:47:23
- **(Need to discuss with team) Remove ability to answer trivia qs w/o logging in? ==> Decision: don't remove, fix
  - Source of many bugs, including the KeyError and 'Response' object not Subscriptable bug
- Fixed KeyError and Subscriptable bug with if statements; if session username not set (user not logged in),
then redirect user to login page

qinaL -- 2022-01-03 16:35 (for push 2 hrs ago)
- profile now displays num of fire extinguishers, total qus right and wrong
    - for every 10 qus rights, user gets a hint; every 10 wrong, a fire extinguisher
        - these 2 counts are displayed on profile; actual functioning should work (but should get more testing)
    - 4 counters added to indiv user's table, and each counter has a function that retrieves their num
    - rightcounters() for incrementing when get qu right; wrongcounters() for incrementing when get qu wrong
- actual functioning of fire extinguishers not implemented yet

qinaL -- 2021-01-03 17:01
- consolidated the getNumOfRightQus(), getNumOfGoalRight(), and their wrong counterparts into one function- getNumOfCounter(counter), where counter is a string that denoted which specific counter is being asked for; avoids a lot of repeating code
- small profile front-end changes

thomasY -- 2022-01-03 21:28
- Created the function letterFirst to check if the first char of the username is a letter
  - SQLite3 tables cannot have a number first for its name

yayingLL -- 2022-01-04 00:53:23
- fixed how user can gain a new collectible by simply refreshing gain page
  - redirect user back to more trivia questions instead
- display number of fire extinguishers in html pages

joshuaK -- 2022-01-04 1:03
- changed repeat to go in other table
