- Updated design doc
- Fixed tables to deal avoid lists in a db entry/row
  - Insead opting for a table per user (table name = username)

qinaL -- 2021-12-09 21:28
- added some small specifications/illustration to database
- added optional risky questions for if we have additional time to implement to increase fun factor \

yayingLL -- 2021-12-10 09:20

qinaL -- 2021-12-11 22:58
- added requirements.txt

qinaL -- 2021-12-12 16:03
- added Flask to __init__.py, now can run __init__.py to get functional localhost website
- created templates and home.html with link to css and bootstrap
- created static and css folder and style.css
- now have home landing page that displays summary pitch of site

joshuaK -- 2021-12-12 18:05
- added login, register, and table structure

qinaL -- 2021-12-13 20:11
- added css links to login and regiser html
- made it so can see home page and use trivia w/o loggging in
- register and login buttons are on separate pages so traversing login --> register --> login is more intuitive now
- still need to do
    - when users fails to register and logi (bad username/password, login w/o register)
    - need home page to change when logged in (no login button b/c user is logged in
- issue
    - if user does not land on "/" page first, then table won't be created

yayingLL -- 2021-12-14 16:29
- added error handling for register page (no username, no password, password don't match, username taken)

qinaL -- 2021-12-14 19:23
- changed href="home" in navbar to href="/" because the former threw an error
- /auth get method redirects to /login and not / anymore
- added login error handling for when username is empty, username is not found in database, or the password is wrong

thomasY -- 2021-12-14 21:01
- Update from class period: Got a working navbar
- Added Jinja2 if statement to login and signup
  - Will only show up if the user is not logged in
  - Added logout to show up when the user is logged in

qinaL -- 2021-12-15
- login works now (i think?, i hope), wont throw wrong password error when right password
    - c.fetchone()[0] because c.fetchone is ('e',)

yayingLL -- 2021-12-15 23:27
- fixed bindings error in register page (added , to signify values were tuples)
- fixed wrong password error in login page (qina's observations were a big yes! convert tuple into string, then compare passwords)
- added gathering of trivia questions from api
- displayed question, answer, and incorrect answers into trivia.html page

thoamsY -- 2021-12-16 09:13
- Created profile.html
- Added if statements and for loops to create the different sections of the page

yayingLL -- 2021-12-16 22:43
- added axolotl, dog, and cat api collection of data to Flask
- created collectibles.html for displaying animal and description

joshuaK -- 2021-12-15
- started asking trivia question and recieving answer

joshuaK -- 2021-12-16
- fully functional trivia question multiple choice

qinaL -- 2021-12-19 16:14
- swapped out session['username'] for session.get('username'); idk why or how but the former throws an error in trivia
- changed animal-specific fucntions to return a tuple of (pic, desc) rather than rendering template
    - render_template of collectibles.html is in trivia
    - inserting collectible data into table is also in trivia
    - trivia for when answer is correct now works w/p (hopefully) any errors
- added to collectibles.html so when getting a collectible and not logged in, a message of "To keep this collectible, please log in!" in red is given
- created base.html as the parent template for jinja inheritance (only burn.html extends off it, other templates not converted for jinja inheritance yet)
- created burn.html for when user gets question wrong and the collectible is burned; only displays collectible and a message saying it's burned, but the style/css leaves much to be desired and the burning effect of image still needs work
    - when answer is wrong, this template is rendered instead of redirecting to home page

qinaL -- 2021-12-19 20:19
- moved creation of users database from "/" to "/login"
- added CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS to "/register" for users.db in case users goes directly to "/register" and skipped table creation in "/login"
- added some <br> to collectibles.html and burn.html so formatting of page looks nicer
- tested to see if code for adding collectible when logged in works, fixed some errors I found, (hopefully) works now but there should probably be more testing
- added "/logout" so users can now logout
- got rid of login button on the home page (it looked bad), log in + log out will be allocated only to navbar
- added an catch for when logged in users try to login; loggedlock.html (uses jinja inheritance) is rendered instead
- found error: if user does trivia, navbar will show logout even if not logged in because session has correct_answer and navbar checks for if session is empty to determine if it's logged in or not
    - fixed error by changing {% if session %} to {% if session['username'] %}
    - fixed only in trivia.html and base.html; too tired to copy paste it into the other templates

yayingLL -- 2021-12-19 21:00
- moved inserting collectible to the person's database ONLY if they got the correct answer
- deleted previous db file because it didn't include Number column
  - all users registered from now on have a Number column
- randomized presentation of answers in trivia questions
  - previously, correct answer would always be the last choice

yayingLL -- 2021-12-20 9:23
- incorporated jinja inheritance with base.html for most pages

qinaL -- 2021-12-20 20:06
- added try except blocks in the code that gets api info; if api fails, animal-specific functions returns "Error," which trivia catches for and renders error.html to tell user that the site is currently down
    - THOU SHALT NOT FAIL
    - error.html was created

yayingLL -- 2021-12-20 23:39
- started on hints -- relationships are so complex

thomasY -- 2021-12-21 09:07
- Updated collectibles and burn so the image has a max height
- Images now resize alongside the browser window

joshuaK -- 2021-12-21 9:15
- made it so if logged out and than log in the collectible is saved

qinaL -- 2021-12-21 18:18
- there was an issue with the implementation of logged out but logging in the save collectible, throws an error when you go back to home w/o saving collectibe; fixed error
- changed style of site a bit
